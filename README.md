Title of Paper: Comprehensive Comparison of Machine Learning and Kalman Filter Battery State of Charge Estimators
Authors: Romulo Vieira, (Graduate Student Member, IEEE), Phil Kollmeyer, (Member, IEEE), Lea Pitault and Ali Emadi, (Fellow, IEEE).

Process and Measurement Noise for Multi-Temperature Extended Kalman Filter.pdf contains the values for the process and measurement noise for Multi-Temperature EKF and UKF used for State of Charge Estimation using
the 21700 Tesla Model 3 Cylindrical Cell.
After running the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for each filter (EKF and UKF) and temperature combination, the process noise (Q) and measurement noise (R) were compiled into the Tables 1 and 2.
